# Super-Turismo

**Team Members:** Shubham Dhall

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Its a sim-racing game where you will have multiple tracks and cars to choose from. You can race in one of the most Iconic tracks like in the streets of Monaco or even the Indianapolis 500. You have a variety of cars to choose from such as hyper cars like the LaFerrari or an F1 car like Aryton Senna's 1991 McLaren.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Players can compete in races with Ai's of different difficulty to match their skill level. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players will select the car they want to drive, the track they want to race in, then they can race with Ai's.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
Players will have many cars and tracks to choose from and each racesince each race is 3 laps each race will be approx 5 minutes long. I'm planning to make 6 tracks so players can race in each one of them for about 30 minutes without repeating the same track.
